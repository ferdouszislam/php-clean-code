DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself - write repeated codes inside a function
KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid - go for the stupidest solution first (linear search before binary search)


Variable Naming Rules:
- descriptive, easy to search, easy to pronounce. 
- don't add type information, avoid encodings.
- replace magic numbers with constants.


Comments:
- The code is the best documentation.
- Use only to clarify code.


Functions:
- Place functions in the downward direction.
- keep it simple and short, do only one thing inside a function. Rule of thumb: fits in your monitor.
	- keep number of parameters small, 
	- avoid passing booleans (are you trying to do more than one thing?) 
	- use language provided library functions (sorting, searching, data structures etc.)
- AVOID SIDE EFFECTS (changing variables passed by reference)


Class:
- use public, private, protected keywords.
- keep small, and only for single purpose.
- small number of instance variables.
- super class should know nothing of it's sub classes.
- keep utility variables and methods private.
- avoid redundancy by inheriting from classes.


Tests:
- fast to execute.
- should not depend on other tests.
- one assert per test.
- TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT - writing unit tests while you are writing the code (or before writing new code).
